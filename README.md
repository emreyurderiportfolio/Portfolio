## Sentiment Analysis Using VADER and TextBlob

***Evaluates the performance of two popular natural language processing tools, **VADER** and **TextBlob**, for sentiment analysis. Using a dataset of textual reviews with ground truth sentiment labels, the project aims to classify sentiments as Positive, Neutral, or Negative and compare the strengths and weaknesses of both tools.***

## Interactive Bike Station Analyzer with Shiny App in R

***R Shiny Application provides an interactive visualization regarding the Isbike stations' coordinates, availability status, station names and the last time that connected to the system wile getting the report.***

## Vehicle Positioning and Demand Prediction Using Deep Learning

***Focuses on predicting high-demand regions for vehicle positioning based on historical demand data and time-based features. Various deep learning models, including fully connected neural networks and advanced models like Transformers, were tested to identify optimal strategies. The project leverages the attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy by focusing on critical features such as lag values and cyclic time-based patterns.***
